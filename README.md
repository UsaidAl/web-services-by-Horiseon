# Horiseon Web Services

This is my week 1 refactoring HTML challenge.

## Description

For this task, I have made the following changes:

- The HTML was converted to Semantic HTML.
- The images now have alt attributes.
- Media queries were added, to support use on smaller screens.
- All redundant code from CSS removed.
- I have added comments to both my HTML and CSS files, describing each section.
